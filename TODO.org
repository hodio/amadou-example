** TODO Admin templates are not loaded with the `app_loader`

   Somehow, now templates from libraries are loaded. The list of template
   directories of apps is completely empty. I already looked at the
   permissions, but they seem to be fine.
   
** TODO Replace uWSGI sleep with hook.

   Currently we have to sleep for 15 seconds before starting uWSGI so that
   the vagrant share is up. This is a dirty way of doing it. A pull request
   is already on Vagrant which supplies a hook after putting the share online.
